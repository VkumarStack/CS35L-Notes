Software applications can communicate with each other through the operating system. 

Introspection refers to a program looking at itself; i.e. using the terminal command "ps" (list processes)
causes the shell to list itself.
    - When constructing software, it is important to keep introspection in mind since it may be useful to find out 
    about a program when something goes wrong

Software tools philosophy: You should not attempt to write a big program to solve all of your problems. Rather, you should 
write your applications using a collection of tools, each of which are simple and tailored towards solving specific problems.
You should not try to have one tool be too "large" in a sense that it is overused in your application. 

Little languages philosophy: Software tools may need to be configured. One should design small languages, appropriate for each
tool. These languages should NOT scale - they should be tailored for that tool only. As an example, the shell (sh) has a small 
scripting language (not a major language like C, etc) to simply approach problems. Another example one may consider is Lisp for 
Emacs.

Throughput: Bits per second for data to transfer
Latency: Amount of time for data to transfer (i.e. speed of light considerations)

Terminal interfaces are efficient because they only need to transfer text. Graphical interfaces require lots of bandwith.

Shell (sh) Commands:
    - ps: List processes and their IDs
        -e: Flag to see ALL processes, not just thsoe running in the shell
    - top: Task manager, with most consuming processes listed at the top 
    - kill [PID]: Kills process, given its process ID
    - sh: Creates another instance of the shell
        - sh -c 'command': Creates another instance of the shell only for doing that given command
    - sleep [time]: Delay for a given amount of time  
    - echo [argument]: Outputs argument 
    - less: Like more, but does not read the entire file at once
    - sudo: Allows you to enter the shell with root permissions (a lot of power)
        - Avoid being in sudo mode to minimize privileges that may be harmful

    - To sequence shell commands, separate different commands with ";" (i.e. ls ; echo "hello")
    - To run multiple commands in parallel, separate the commands with "&" 
    - The output of one command can be fed as the input of another with "|" (i.e. ls -d | echo)
