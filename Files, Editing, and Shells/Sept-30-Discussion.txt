When a command is executed via the command line, the location of that command is searched for 
through the user's path $PATH. It will look through each directory listed under the user's path 
until it finds the specified command. As a result, it is important to append any necessary 
programs to your PATH if they aren't already. To run a command within the current directory 
instead of searching through $PATH, you you do ./COMM-D. 

The directory $HOME refers to the user's home directory. 

Linux File System Hierarchy:
    /bin: Contains binary (executable) files for essential user commands
    /boot: Contains the Linux kernel needed to boot up the system 
    /dev: Contains device files 
    /etc: Contains system configuration files
    /home: Contains personal directories for users, holding documents, files, settings, etcs.
    /lib: Contains library files that binaries can use 

In Linux, a link is a way to access file (a directory is a file) content.
    A hard link is a way to directly access the file content (a pointer to the file in memory). It 
    is effectively the same thing as the file path. There can be multiple hard links to the same file.
    Deleting all hard links deletes the file. 

    A soft link is more like a shortcut to a file. It stores the path to the file but does not directly point 
    to the file's content. If the original file content is deleted, then the soft link fails. 

    The command ln can link link a file, either via hard link or soft link.
