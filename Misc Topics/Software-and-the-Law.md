# Software and the Law
- Software can be thought of as 1) a set of instructions for a computer and 2) a way of collaborating to solve problems
- Software Laws:
    - Copyright: Governs the copying of creative work - gives the creator of a work the exclusive right over making copies for ~ 20 years (but has been extended due to lobbying)
        - This covers the form of the work, and not necessarily the ideas (the idea can be copied, but the exact details cannot be)
    - Patents: Applies to practical, novel inventions that covers the ideas for ~ 20 years; patents are published
        - Court rulings have gone back and forth at patenting software - generally, if the software is closely tied with mechanical devices, then it can be easily patented
    - Trade Secrets: Ideas that are not published - these secrets are enforced via signed nondisclosure agreements (NDA)
    - Trademarks: Avoids confusion among consumers (FireFox vs EggertFox)
    - Personal Data: Rules about what data organizations can send (i.e. HIPAA laws)
        - These laws are a bit tricky when it comes to software, since more and more companies are collecting data en masse to tailor certain metrics (i.e. targetted advertisements)
- These software laws are enforced via:
    - Infringement accusations for copyright, often via civil suits (this requires first determining if infringement has even occurred - fair use)
    - Copyright can be prevented by keeping one's source code secret 
        - This can involve obfuscation, where the executable or program file is mangled so that is unreadable and therefore harder to copy
- Software licenses grant permissions and are often part of a contract with strings attached
    - Copyright Licenses:
        - Public Domain: Anything can be done with the work
        - Academic Licenses: Require that credit is given (avoid plagiarism) - i.e. BSD, MIT
        - Reciprocal Licenses: If a copy of the work is made and changed, the new work must be also open source (be as generous as the original author) - GPL 
        - Corporate Licenses: The source code can be copied, but if there are changes, the changes must be returned to the original source 
        - Secret Licenses: The source code cannot be seen; the program is just run
